## Overview

I've built a somewhat responsive page. I used a media query to obtain the mobile design results.

### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://stacihs.github.io/qr-code-component/](https://stacihs.github.io/qr-code-component/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I'm not new to web development, but I have been away from it for a few years. I have never been a professional. I'm now pursuing it fulltime, and I'm having to relearn a lot of things.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-css-media-queries/) - I had completely forgotten how to write a media query. I went back to this trusted source. You can search for anything about css on this site. I absoultely recommend it to everyone.
